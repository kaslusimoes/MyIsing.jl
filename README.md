## 2D Square Ising Model on Julia

That's a naive implementation of a 2D Square Ising Model using Julia and some of its packages (especially Graphs.jl but also Gadfly.jl and DataFrames.jl)
It's more of an educational project to myself (based on some 'home exam' that I had to do) than a notorius implementation.
